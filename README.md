# odin-recipes
The purpose of this project is to showcase the HTML
knowledge I have accrued thus far by building a
basic recipe website. I will attempt to showcase my
knowledge of file structure, setting up HTML boiler-
plate code, use of relative paths via local folders, 
and HTML styling through the use of heading and 
paragraph elements.
